# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to understand the survival trends and patterns among passengers. The analysis involves visual and statistical exploration of the dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights from the Titanic dataset, focusing on:
- Identifying trends and relationships between features.
- Visualizing data using different plots (e.g., histograms, boxplots, pairplots).
- Providing a summary of key findings and insights.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)

## Data Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including features such as:
- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Summary of Findings
- **Survival Rate**: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
- **Passenger Class**: Passengers in **1st class** had the highest chance of survival, followed by 2nd class, and 3rd class.
- **Age and Survival**: Younger passengers had a slightly better survival rate, although there were survivors across all age groups.
- **Fare**: Passengers who survived generally paid higher fares than those who did not.
- **Missing Data**: Missing values were found in the **Age**, **Cabin**, and **Embarked** columns, which were handled appropriately during the analysis.

## Visualizations
- **Survival by Gender**: Gender has a clear influence on survival rate, with females surviving at a higher rate than males.
- **Survival by Passenger Class**: Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rates.
- **Age vs Survival**: Older passengers had lower survival rates, but survival was not solely dependent on age.
- **Fare Distribution**: Higher fares were paid by those with a higher chance of survival.
